## Let's take a look at API72

Your API is divided up into three major pages that are designed to help you build your API as well as compliment your level of experience-- beginner to experience developer.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="API Kit">
    **Meant for all levels of development experience from beginner to experienced developer.**

    > This is your one stop shop for all the information you will need to understand, build, and manage your API. Use your API Kit to help orient yourself inside of your API72 development experience as well as educate yourself to use more advanced tools offered in the other pages.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="square-code" title="Apollo Server">
    **For advanced and experienced developers**

    > This server is powered by GraphQL which is a leading standard in query based API which API72 supports.

    > Don't understand anything that was said? That's ok! Make sure to go through the beginner and intermediate tutorials if you want to use this powerful tool as well as supplement information by checking out the [GraphQL offical page](https://graphql.org/).

    > If your familiar with GraphQL, we have integrated an [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/getting-started) for you that sends request to your Node Server that executes your API requests. Make sure to check out the advanced the tutorials to see how to best use our integration of Apollo Server powered by GraphQL.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Node Server">
    **For advanaced and experienced developers**

    > Your Node server is the brains behind your API. All API calls will be parsed and handled by the Node server. Check out the [Documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart) page to better understand how to make direct calls to the server without using the Apollo Server.
    
    > Don't know what Node is? That's Ok! Just check out the beginner tutorials to learn more about what Node is and how your API utilizes it to power all the cool functionality that exits in your API.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
