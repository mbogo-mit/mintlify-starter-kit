Beginners should **watch the first 100 seconds of the video** below. If your interested in the topic and want to dive deeper finish the video to learn more about Node.js servers. This is optional but beneficial as your API uses a Node.js server; however, the tutorials will cover that information later on.

## Major Takeaways

### What are APIs used for?

APIs are used to communicate with backend services. They help you the client get, save, and calculate information you have. In this tutorial you will see how we can use API requests to get data about your API. Stay tuned!

### What is an API reqeust?

Its the protocol we use to communicate with our backend service. To begin this tutorial we will first navigate to the API reference page. This is where beginner developers can make user friendly API calls to their API. To see how this works we will be making a request to your API's archeticture ledger (picture below).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-light.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

When making this API call you can see that there are many different fields that we can fill. The good thing is we are going to keep things simple. This API call is actually already set up for you to get data with one click. 
Notice how when you click **Send** you get a response back. You just made your first API call to your API. Its that easy!

### What does this all mean?

```md
![title](/path/image.jpg)
```

Note that the image file size must be less than 5MB. Otherwise, we recommend hosting on a service like [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). You can then use that URL and embed.

### Using Embeds

To get more customizability with images, you can also use [embeds](/writing-content/embed) to add images

```html
<img height="200" src="/path/image.jpg" />
```

## Embeds and HTML elements

<iframe

  title="YouTube video player"
  frameBorder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowFullScreen
  style={{ width: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
></iframe>

<Tip>

Mintlify supports [HTML tags in Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#html). This is helpful if you prefer HTML tags to Markdown syntax, and lets you create documentation with infinite flexibility.

### iFrames

Loads another HTML page within the document. Most commonly used for embedding videos.

```html
