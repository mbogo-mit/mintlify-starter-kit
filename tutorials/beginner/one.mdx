Beginners should **watch the first 100 seconds of the video** below. If your interested in the topic and want to dive deeper finish the video to learn more about Node.js servers. This is optional but beneficial as your API uses a Node.js server; however, the tutorials will cover that information later on.

## Major Takeaways

### What are APIs used for?

APIs are used to communicate with backend services. They help you the client get, save, and calculate information you have. In this tutorial you will see how we can use API requests to get data about your API. Stay tuned!

### What is an API reqeust?

Its the protocol we use to communicate with our backend service. To begin this tutorial we will first navigate to the API reference page. This is where beginner developers can make user friendly API calls to their API. To see how this works we will be making a request to your API's archeticture ledger (picture below).

<img
  className="block dark:hidden"
  src="/images/hero-light.svg"
  alt="Hero Light"
/>
<img
  className="hidden dark:block"
  src="/images/hero-dark.svg"
  alt="Hero Dark"
/>

When making this API call you can see that there are many different fields that we can fill. The good thing is we are going to keep things simple. This API call is actually already set up for you to get data with one click. 
Notice how when you click **Send** you get a response back. You just made your first API call to your API. Its that easy!

### What does this all mean?

Hopefully after this tutorial you have gotten a little more familiar with your API Kit as well as interested in the power of your API. So far we have shown you a simple functionality of your API. We were able to see the structure of the API currently. But there's much more!

### What makes my API special

So in the tutorial you saw all the services that make up your API-- recall your API's response.

```
query Create($nameId: String!) {
  api {
    aws {
      websocket(nameID: $nameId) {
        name
        nameID
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's take this a step further. You can see that your API starts out connected to very few services. What if you wanted to create a streaming app or social media app? You need a database to save photos and messages as well as some way to support real time communication, but this API doesn't have any of those services. This is where the magic happens! With API72, we created what is called a **Dynamic API**. A Dynamic API allows you to add services to your API by making a request to your API to tell it to make what you need. In the next tutorial you will make your first Dynamic API call where you will see how your API can **evolve!**
